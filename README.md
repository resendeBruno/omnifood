# [OMNIFOOD](https://resendebruno.github.io/omnifood/index.html)

This is a simple one-page website featuring the fictitious Omnifood company. This is built and taught from an Udemy course [RWD and Development with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/).

Few minor changes to mobile site:
- Navigation menu (always sticky, closes automatically when an item is pressed)
- Navigation menu (items float to the right, now on the middle)
- Features section (text is justified)
- Meals section (used to load 4 items in same row, now loads only 2)
- Cities section (used to show image and text separately, now shows image as background for the text)
- Footer (both lists floats to the side and each list item is displayed in different a row)
